1️⃣ Bin2Dec 0️⃣ - Binary to Decimal Converter
A simple yet effective tool to convert binary numbers (base 2) into decimal numbers (base 10). This project was developed to strengthen logic skills and master data manipulation within the .NET environment.

🚀 Features Completed:
[x] User Input: Accepts strings of binary digits via the console.

[x] Strict Validation: Implementation of logic to ensure the user only enters 0s and 1s.

[x] Conversion Engine: Mathematical conversion logic using the power of 2 for each bit position.

[x] Real-time Output: Displays the calculated decimal result immediately to the user.

🛠 Tech Stack:
Language: C#

Framework: .NET (Console Application)

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

💻 How to Run:
Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine.

Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/VictoRGBC/Bin2Dec.git
Navigate to the project folder:

Bash
cd Bin2Dec
Run the application:

Bash
dotnet run
📜 Challenge Rules Followed:
The application identifies and alerts the user if any non-binary digit is entered.

The logic focuses on iterative mathematical calculation rather than simple built-in library shortcuts.
